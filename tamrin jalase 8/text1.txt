Once upon a time, long ago and far away,
 there was a village that stood by the sea.
 Of course, the people had carefully built 
their houses so that they were not affected 
by the high tide, but on the edge of the town
 there grew a great fig tree that hung over
 both the houses and sea. In the water below 
the tree, sharks liked to come up and splash 
about, and the humans kept well away for safety.
