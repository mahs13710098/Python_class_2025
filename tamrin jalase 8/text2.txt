But not all were so careful, and every morning a small
 grey monkey could be found swinging from branch to branch,
 picking figs and snacking on them as he went. He was nimble
 and clever, and never fell into the water. Once he had
 finished his breakfast, the little creature climbed down the
 tree and found a nice spot in the shade to relax, and one day,
 he noticed a shark watching him from the water.‘Can I help you,
 friend?’ the monkey asked politely.‘Oh! Dear monkey, I would be
 ever so grateful if you could toss me down some of those things
 in the tree. I have never tasted them, and for fifty years I have
 only eaten salty fish, which I am oh so tired of.’
